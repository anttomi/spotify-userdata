# spotify-userdata

Spotify_normal is for data that you can ask from your spotify page
Spotify is for the extended data that you get when asking via email


Includes crappy UI!

Todo:

Refacturing, better UI, combining both scripts.


Spotify_normal has to have StreamingHistory.json files in same folders.
Spotify has to have endsong_.json files in same folder.
